  "about": "This website was created as part of the COMP6841 Something Awesome Project. The purpose of my project is to educate the general public about Cryptography specifically. However, it has grown from solely focusing on cryptography to be more of a catch-all for common CTF challenges. In my project, I have completed several CTF challenges ranging from low to high level and written up my process in extensive detail. Additionally, I have created similar examples of these challenges as well as tools that can be used for solving.",

    "explain" : "Capture the flag (CTF) challenges are common exercises in computer security where a program is purposefully vulnerable to allow the challenge participant to find exploits and recover the 'flag' text string. The term comes from the playground sport of the same name. Much like this entire project, CTF challenges are educational and offer hands-on technical applications of concepts learned.",
