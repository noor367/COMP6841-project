# Over The Wire CTF - Krypton

NOTE TO SELF: REMOVE ALL PWD BEFORE PUSHING

The bandit CTF challenges on [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames) are used to gain familiarity and introduce oneself to common CTF tools and procedures. This is an introductory hands-on experience that builds skills and confidence before I move on to HackTheBox CTF challenges.

This writeup and guide is not meant to spoil the learning experience for anyone else interested in these wargames challenges. This is a warning that the following content will analyse and describe aspects of the challenges as well as my approach and how I "captured the flag".
